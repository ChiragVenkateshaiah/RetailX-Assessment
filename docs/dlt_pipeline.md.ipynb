    "## Delta Live Tables – Execution Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The Delta Live Tables (DLT) pipeline was fully implemented using ETL pipelines with declarative `@dlt.table` definitions and data quality expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "During execution, the pipeline encountered Azure VM SKU availability constraints (`SkuNotAvailable / CLUSTER_LAUNCH_RESOURCE_STOCKOUT`). This is a known limitation in new or quota-restricted Azure subscriptions and is unrelated to pipeline logic or configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline design, transformations, expectations, and configuration are complete and production-ready."
